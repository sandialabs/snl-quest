  /*
   * Below are Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) definitions in use in this file,
   * which allow easily changing how counties are displayed.
   *
   *
   * For the U.S. Census county codes (FIPS codes) used in this file to identify individual counties, see this link:
   * https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt
   *
   * The county codes used in this file combine the 2-digit state code, which is in the second column of the file
   * linked above, and the 3-digit county code, which is in the third column of the file linked above. Each value
   * for the "id" attribute for each county is in the following form: "c[state_code][county-code]". For example,
   * for Loving Country in Texas, the state code is "48" and the county code is "301", so the id name for the
   * county is "c48301".
   *
   * County codes used in this file can also be found on Wikimedia Commons at this link:
   * https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Usa_counties_large.svg/county_codes
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * To color two counties red (in this case Loving County and Dallas County in Texas) simply
   * go to the CSS insertion point and add:
   *
   * #c48301, #c48113 {fill:red}
   *
   * To color an entire state's counties (in the case New Mexico, with "35" being the state code) a green,
   * go to the CSS insertion point and add:
   *
   * path[id*='c35'] {fill:#34A853}
   *
