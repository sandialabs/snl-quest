<div class="section" id="arbitrage-only">
<h2>Arbitrage only<a class="headerlink" href="#arbitrage-only" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Arbitrage, in this context, refers to the managing state of charge by buying and selling energy. A storage device engaging in arbitrage is trying to maximize profit from buying energy at low prices and selling energy at higher prices, subject to the constraints of the storage facility. Valuation with this particular revenue stream only has the same formulation among all market areas.</p>
<p>For a storage device that participates in arbitrage only, the decision variables are <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{d}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{r}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The recursion relation describing the state of charge <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span> for <span class="math">\(i &gt; 0\)</span> is given by:</p>
<div class="math">
\[s_{i+1} = \eta_\text{s} s_i + \eta_\text{c} q_i^\text{r} - q_i^\text{d}\]</div>
<p>with:</p>
<div class="math">
\[s_0 = S_0\]</div>
<p>The constraints on the state of charge <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span>, the quantity purchased <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{r}\)</span>, and the quantity sold <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{d}\)</span> at each time step <span class="math">\(i\)</span> are given by:</p>
<div class="math">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\delta_\text{s}^\text{min} \bar{S} \leq s_i\\s_i \leq (1 - \delta_\text{s}^\text{max}) \bar{S}\\q_i^\text{r} + q_i^\text{d} \leq \bar{Q}\\s_N = S_0\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math">\(i \in \mathcal{T}\)</span>. The first two sets of constraints limits the state of charge between its minimum and maximum values as specified at each time step. The next set of constraints limits the total energy charged over the time step (both charging and discharging) to the energy charge limit (derived from the power limit) at each time step. This constraint permits charging and discharging during the same time step but restricts the throughput based on the power rating.</p>
<p>The objective is to maximize the total revenue over the time horizon. We do not include costs associated with, e.g., charging or discharging. If data is available, it may be included in the objective function, changing the objective to profit maximization. Otherwise, the objective function for the arbitrage only model is:</p>
<div class="math">
\[J = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{T}} \left [q_i^\text{d} - q_i^\text{r} \right ] \lambda_i e^{-Ri}\]</div>
<p>Revenue is solely generated by buying and selling energy. The arbitrage only model can therefore be summarized as:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\max_{q^\text{d}, q^\text{r}, s} J\]</div>
<p>subject to:</p>
<div class="math">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}s_{i+1} = \eta_\text{s} s_i + \eta_\text{c} q_i^\text{r} - q_i^\text{d}\\\delta_\text{s}^\text{min} \bar{S} \leq s_i \leq (1 - \delta_\text{s}^\text{max}) \bar{S}\\q_i^\text{r} + q_i^\text{d} \leq \bar{Q}\\s_0 = S_0\\s_N = S_0\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>

<p class="last">In many areas, the net energy for regulation is settled at the real-time price. This provides an additional arbitrage opportunity between the day ahead price and the real-time price. These models are primarily concerned with arbitrage and regulation revenue from the day ahead market; therefore, the price <span class="math">\(\lambda_i\)</span> typically represents the day ahead LMP. While this does not reflect the actual settlement process, it keeps the optimization from incorporating any arbitrage between the day ahead and the real-time market.</p>

<h2>Arbitrage and regulation (ERCOT)<a class="headerlink" href="#arbitrage-and-regulation-ercot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ERCOT has a frequency regulation market that does not explicitly provide credits based on frequency regulation performance, only for capacity offered. It offers different prices for regulation up and regulation down is thus considered a <em>two product frequency regulation</em> market.</p>
<p>For a storage device that participates in both arbitrage and frequency regulation, the decision variables are <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{d}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{r}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{ru}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q_i^\text{rd}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span>.</p>

The <span class="math">\(\delta_\text{reg}\)</span> factors are safety factors used to reserve energy capacity headroom and/or legroom to avoid penalties due to not meeting regulation obligations; they are defined as fractions of the capacity bid. The next set of constraints limits the total energy charged over the time step (both charging and discharging) to the energy charge limit (derived from the power limit) at each time step. This constraint permits charging and discharging during the same time step but restricts the throughput based on the power rating. Bids for regulation up/down are constrained together with arbitrage-related actions.</p>
<p>The objective function for the model is:</p>
<div class="math">
\[J = \sum_\mathcal{i \in T} \left [ \left(q_i^\text{d} - q_i^\text{r} \right) \lambda_i + \lambda_i^{c,ru} q_i^\text{ru} + \lambda_i^{c,rd} q_i^\text{rd} + \left( \delta_i^\text{ru} q_i^\text{ru} - \delta_i^\text{rd} q_i^\text{rd} \right) \lambda_i \right ] e^{-Ri}\]</div>
<p>In addition to the arbitrage revenue stream, electricity prices are accounted for depending on the actual amount of the regulation bid that is called upon. Additionally, the revenue from regulation up/down bids are included. The ERCOT arbitrage and regulation model can therefore be summarized as:</p>

<p>where RegD is a high pass filtered ACE signal designed for faster responding resources and RegA is the low pass filtered equivalent designed for traditional regulating resources.

<p>The objective function for the model is:</p>
<div class="math">
\[J = \sum_\mathcal{T} \left [ \left(q_d(t) - q_r(t) \right) \lambda(t) + \left( 1 + \alpha \right) \Gamma \lambda_c(t) q_{reg}(t) \right ] e^{-Rt}\]</div>
<p>In this model, only one price for regulation services is used: RegMCP and is associated with the <span class="math">\(\lambda_c(t)\)</span> interface. Like in the PJM model, the credit is scaled by a performance score parameter. The &#8220;make whole&#8221; parameter, <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, is a system-wide parameter used to adjust the regulation service credit such that the market payout is &#8220;balanced&#8221; in an ensemble and temporal sense.</p>
<p>The MISO arbitrage and regulation model can be summarized as:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\max_{q_d(t), q_r(t), q_{reg}(t), s(t)} J\]</div>
<p>subject to:</p>
<div class="math">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\gamma_{reg}^{min} q_{ru}(t) + \gamma_{s}^{min} \bar{S} \leq s(t+1)\\s(t+1) \leq (1 - \gamma_{s}^{max}) \bar{S} - \eta_c \gamma_{reg}^{max} q_{rd}(t)\\q_r(t) + q_d(t) + q_{reg}(t) \leq \bar{Q}\\S(N) = S_0\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math">\(t \in \mathcal{T}\)</span>.</p>
